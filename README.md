## My Dream

_Having a **$1B protocol TVL** that I at least helped to code._

---

## Summary

I‚Äôm an already seasoned blockchain developer with a deep understanding of smart contract and Bitcoin development as I‚Äôm in the field since the **‚Äúcolored coins‚Äù** and **‚Äúmasternode‚Äù** revolution, even before _The Pandemic_.

My involvement in blockchain technology predates Ethereum. In the early days of Bitcoin, I was an active participant in the Bitcoin forum, contributing my expertise in **C++/QT** development. I assisted teams working on masternodes and privacy coins, as these applications were primarily built using **C++/QT** at that time as I had lots of experience in **C++** from my telecom background.

After masternodes and privacy coins fallout, I moved to **EVM** during **SUSHI DEX** rise up, helping here and then, assisting teams in the farming era.

Right now, my focus is more on **decentralized finance (DeFi)**, working on new edge protocol deployments on EVM chains, especially on **Cosmos/EVM protocols**.

Also, sometimes, I integrate **AI and DeFi**, like the **[$NAAI protocol](https://etherscan.io/token/0x7865ec47bef9823ad0010c4970ed90a5e8107e53#code)**, where I created their entire backend for an "AI auditing contract" solution and coded their smart contract with some nice anti-snipe bot features.

So far, until today, no protocol has been hacked as I‚Äôm very careful with Solidity coding and ensure **full test coverage** and I never deploy a protocol without full testing it with test-cases.
