## My Dream

Having a **$1B protocol TVL** that I at least helped to code.

---

## Summary

I’m an already seasoned blockchain developer with a deep understanding of smart contract and Bitcoin development as I’m in the field since the **“colored coins”** and **masternode** revolution. 

Even before Ethereum, I was in the bitcoin forum helping with masternodes and privacy coins teams with my experience in **C++/QT** as these apps were just **C++/QT** code, a long time ago.

After masternodes and privacy coins fallout, I moved to **EVM** during **SUSHI DEX** rise up, helping here and then, assisting teams in the farming era.

Right now, my focus is more on **decentralized finance (DeFi)**, working on new edge protocol deployments on EVM chains, especially on **Cosmos/EVM protocols**.

Also, sometimes, I integrate **AI and DeFi**, like the **$NAAI protocol**, where I created their entire backend for an “AI auditing contract” solution and coded their smart contract with some nice anti-snipe bot features.

So far, until today, no protocol has been hacked as I’m very careful with Solidity coding and ensure **full test coverage**—I never deploy a protocol without it.
